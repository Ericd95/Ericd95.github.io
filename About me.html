         I was born and raised in Portland, Maine, where I lived with my parents, older brother, Corey and younger sister, Maria. I attended Deering High School and graduated in June of 2014. After high school, I was recruited to swim for the Virginia Tech Hokies! I swam there for two years before eventually making the tough decision of retiring from the sport and eventually transfered back to Maine. Currently, I have one year left of school and am excited to see where my post-graduation life will take me! Although I am not sure entirely of what law school I will be attending, I hope to either go overseas for an international approach to learning law or to go somewhere with less of a winter than Maine!
