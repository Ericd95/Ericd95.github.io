<h2>Eric DelMonte</h2>
<h3>Psych major</h3>

<p>
Welcome to my webpage! I am a senior at the university of Maine and am currently studying psychology. 
After graduating from the University of Maine I plan to hopefully go onto law school, where I hope to become an IP attorney. 
</p>

<p>
On this webpage you will find links to learn a little bit more about me personally, as well as some of the things that have had the biggest influence on my life.
