Competitive Swimming
          </aside>
Swimming played an enormous role in my life growing up. I had begun swimming at the age of 5 and did so until I was 21. This sport allowed me to meet some of the closest friends I have today, as well as teaching me how to work hard while also balancing a school and social life. I believe it is because of this sport that I have learned how to work hard while encouraging and leading a team. Swimming was such an amazing experience, fortunately I was able to qualify for competitions where many olympians, like Michael Phelps, would attend. Going to swim meets of this caliber really made me realize that I CAN achieve anything I put my heart, mind and hard work into.         <section>
