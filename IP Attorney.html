         IP attorneys are lawyers that specialize in working with entrepreneurs whom are trying to receive a patent for one of their products. They work hand-in-hand with clients in order to help guide the inventors through research and the application process which will allow the inventors to create a patent that will protect their invention. They also work with companies to help protect certain 'trade secrets', as well as being able to help people obtain and maintain trademarks and copyrights.
